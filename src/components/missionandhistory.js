                    <p> 
                        Our mission is to strengthen the Oregon State University community by fostering connections between students and building stronger programming skills through quarterly coding competitions and workshops.

                <h2>Our Start</h2>
                <p> 
                    Because the OSU Hackathon Club was originally created with the needs of Ecampus CS students in mind, our monthly meetings, weekly HackerWeeks competitions, and quarterly BeaverHacks hackathons are held entirely online.
                    Through small, humble beginnings our club has continued to grow through the support of OSU students, alumni and faculty. We welcome tech enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels, experiences, and majors!
