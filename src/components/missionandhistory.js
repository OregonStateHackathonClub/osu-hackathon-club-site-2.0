                    <p> 
                        Our mission is to strengthen the Oregon State University community by fostering connections between students and building stronger programming skills through quarterly project-based coding competitions and workshops.

                <h2>Our Start</h2>
                <p> 
                    Because the Hackathon Club was originally created with the needs of Ecampus CS students in mind, our weekly meetings and quarterly  hackathons are available online. Our weekly meetings and hackathon kickoffs are also available in person on the Corvallis campus.
                    Through small, humble beginnings our club has continued to grow through the support of students, alumni and faculty. We welcome tech enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels, experiences, and majors!
